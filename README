  My first java application, FileFilter, creates a sync folder on your
desktop (by default, user can specifiy a location). The user defines a 
set of rules based on filetype that defines where she wants that
filetype to be moved to. For example, a user might want her music files
synced to dropbox, pictures to box.net, and videos to cubby.com, etc.
Well just set up a FilterRule that filters all music files that are
moved to your sync file are automatically moved to the destination 
defined by the FilterRule.
